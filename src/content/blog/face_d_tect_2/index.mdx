# Process

## 1. Brief

With this project we were given three areas of interest to design within.  We chose stream of augmenting urban environments with the goal of empowering disadvantaged and marginalised communities.  Furthermore, we were interested in the way computerised mass surveillance exacerbates the effect of stigmatisation and marginalisation to any group that does not fit within the 'norm'.

However, as we researched ways of supporting these communities, we discovered that attempting to focus on a single area and engineer an isolated solution is often unhelpful and can result in an extension of the marginalisation we were attempting to combat.  As a result we decided to take a holistic approach by generating empathy within the broader population towards the groups most affected.  

## 2. Concept Generation

Building off the idea of empathy and reflection, we generated 12 initial concepts before deciding on the two most promising concepts to develop further.

#### Concept 1: Black Mirror

> You approach an artwork made of a portrait mirror with multiple screens surrounding it.  On one side you read 
> `#27 | Male | 24yo | Curios`.  You look into the mirror and it flashes.  On the same screen now reads `#28 | Female | 26yo | Confused`.  You are woman, you had your 26th birthday last month and you were confused by what the installation might be.

Black mirror took a less direct approach by aiming to bring to light the potential for misuse of computerised surveillance both in general and as an extension of current discriminatory sentiments.

#### Concept 2: Anti-hostile Architecture

> You walk by a bench that looks unlike any you've seen before.  You sit down, after a moment, parts of the bench poke up from below you causing you to stand up.  You sit down again, this time leaning back and laying down.  Nothing pokes up.

The installation's goal was to juxtapose with hostile architecture benches that disallowed sleeping and .
