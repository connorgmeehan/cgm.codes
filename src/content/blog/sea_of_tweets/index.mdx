It made use of the Huffington Post pollster and Twitter APIs to get tweets and the sentiment towards each candidate.  This was the project that started my journey and interest in creative coding.",

The sea is a bar chart visualising sentiment towards each candidate, including the ~5% undecided at the time the results were recorded and each boat represents 100,000 followers.

The sky represents the twitter presence, accumulates the total number of likes on each tweet and compares it between the candidates.

Each candidate takes turns saying a tweet, these were queried each hour from the twitter API, however to preserve the functioning of this demo, this currently runs of a cached response from 2017.


import BalloonImg from './sea-of-tweets-balloon.png';

The amount of likes in each tweet is counted in a balloon, one candidate will win and cheer, the other will burst into tears and their balloon will deflate.
