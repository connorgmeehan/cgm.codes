As someone who has more ideas than time to do them I have wanted a blog for a while.  I come up with a lot of project
ideas and would like a place to document my thoughts as I go through them.  I do not like the current trend
of tech giants centralising and controlling access of information, it should be free for all (also I just watched Cooking with Julia).

Sometimes I just want to post a solution to something I've found to share it, maybe I'll write my thoughts on something or just share 
something that helped me.
