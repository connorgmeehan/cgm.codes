import GalleryImage from '../../../components/generics/GalleryImage.tsx';

import WalkthroughVideo from './little-hotelier-walkthrough.mp4';

<video src={WalkthroughVideo} autoplay playsinline muted loop class="my-8" />

With a delivery timeline of 5 weeks I did not have a lot of time to invest in the design
of the project so I fell back on a simple [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) based layout and style.
Although simple, I am fairly happy with the result.

import Help1Video from './help-1.mp4';

<div class="flex gap-2 my-8 justify-center">
    <video class="w-1/3" src={Help1Video} autoplay playsinline muted loop />
</div>

One thing I wanted to be sure to invest in was usability.  I implemented hotkeys and mouse controls
for the most common actions, panning, tilting and rotating the figure.  Additionally, I suggested and
got approval the inclusion of a help menu within the app to aid onboarding new users within the organisation.

import ExportImg from './export_size.png';

<GalleryImage client:idle image={ExportImg} />

The app was built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and, [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (but only for the editor).
The Editor would read the source SVG, use the current state of all of the warp, pan, rotate, etc, controls to modify the geometry of the SVG and then return
it to an SVG for export.  To export you simply draw the SVG to a canvas and download the pixel data or download it directly.  
This allowed us to also support the complex Pencil effect for SVGs via the in-built Fractal Noise filter. 

import PencilImg from './pencil-effect.png';

<GalleryImage client:idle image={PencilImg} alt="SVG Pencil Effect in action" />

This project was implemented during my time at [Code on Canvas](https://codeoncanvas.cc/).
