This experience was to sit on the home-page of a high traffic website and be accessible to as many people as possible.
For that reason, we had to keep dependencies and rendering techniques as minimal and optimised as possible.  It was
built using just WebGL and the [`gl-matrix`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gl-matrix) npm package.

This project taught me the pain of quaternions but in the end really strengthened my knowledge of graphics related
mathematics.

This project was implemented during my time at [Code on Canvas](https://codeoncanvas.cc/).
