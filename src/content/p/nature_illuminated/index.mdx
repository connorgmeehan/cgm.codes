## Implementation

We chose the following technologies to implement the project.

- [8thwall](https://www.8thwall.com/) for AR tracking.  Although the WebXR standard threatens to dethrone it, 8thwall is still the best on solution 
for customer facing AR experiences.
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for implementing the UI.  This was the UI library that we at EyeJack had the most experience and that was the main reason for sticking with it.
While I do think most UI frameworks are fairly similar, Vue's implicit data bindings and terse syntax make it especially good for short timeline agency work. 
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering.  Three.js is a great library with a fantastic ecosystem.  I, and the EyeJack agency as a whole, had plenty of experience using it and it was chosen for that reason.

## Issues faced

At the time of the project, 8thwall didn't have a solved solution for the Bloom effect in AR.
I posted a solution on the 8thwall slack and helped another user implement
it which 8thwall later transformed into the [official Three.js Unreal Bloom example](https://www.8thwall.com/playground/postprocessing-bloom)
(credits to [mbalex99](https://github.com/mbalex99) for the [initial shader implementation](https://github.com/mbalex99/threejs-unrealbloompass-transparent-background-example)).

Once the bloom was implemented we ran into another issue, performance.  It turns out running SLAM tracking in the browser uses a lot of resources.
After working with the 3d modelers to ensure that the 3d assets were optimised I spent days making various micro optimisations to make sure it ran
smoothly on older devices.
