This was a fairly short and simple project involving a [8thwall](https://www.8thwall.com/), 
[Three.js](https://www.threejs.org/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) site that would overlay 
and animate Disney Mech Strike branding.  This experience was accessible via a number of on-site
installations as well as packaging on toys.

import PosterImage from './poster.png';

<Image src={PosterImage} height={1000} alt="Woman standing infront of Disney Mech Strike promotional poster with AR Iron Man in background." />

This project was implemented during my time at [Code on Canvas](https://codeoncanvas.cc/).
